### The purpose of this repository ###

This repository exists to set up a clean place for creating internally heated atmospheres and studying them, without making major changes to any big group repositories.

### Goals ###

* Set up a form of the fully compressible navier stokes equations with internal heating
* Study how different forms of that internal heating affect the dynamics of atmospheres
* Learn about internally heated convection in a manageable, controllable workspace so that we can learn about the sun.
